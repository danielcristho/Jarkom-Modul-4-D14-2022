'GROUP BY'
The GROUP BY keyword will aggregate result-set rows that share common criteria (e.g. a column value) and will return all of the unique entries found for such criteria.

'COUNT'
The COUNT() function will return the number of rows that share the same criteria (e.g. column value). This can be very useful in tandem with a GROUP BY

'AS'
SQL also has an AS keyword, which creates an alias of a table or column. An alias is a new name that's given to the returned column or tableâ€”whatever AS specifies.

'ORDER BY'
The ORDER BY keyword sorts the returned data from a query in ascending or descending order based on a specified criteria or column value. We will add this keyword to our previous query to do the following:

    Return a table that contains the number of bikeshare rides that begin in each starting station, organized alphabetically by the starting station.
    Return a table that contains the number of bikeshare rides that begin in each starting station, organized numerically from lowest to highest.
    Return a table that contains the number of bikeshare rides that begin in each starting station, organized numerically from highest to lowest.
